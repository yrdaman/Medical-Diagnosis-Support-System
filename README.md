# 🩺 Medical Diagnosis Support System

An AI-powered web application designed to assist users in identifying possible diseases based on their symptoms using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and pre-trained medical models. The system supports both **text and voice-based** symptom input and provides **first-aid suggestions** and **precautions**, improving accessibility and early awareness in healthcare.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Symptom-based disease prediction using Random Forest Classifier  
- ✅ Multi-symptom tag input system with auto-suggestions  
- ✅ Speech-to-text symptom input using Whisper model  
- ✅ Auto-correction and normalization using Gemini AI  
- ✅ Medical NER using `en_ner_bc5cdr_md` (SciSpacy pre-trained model)  
- ✅ Description and precautions for predicted diseases  
- ✅ User feedback and learning system (CSV-based logging)  
- ✅ User authentication system (Sign up/Login)  
- ✅ Clean, responsive interface with tag-based selection

## 🧠 Technologies Used

### 🔧 Backend
- Python (Django)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
- Pre-trained models (`en_ner_bc5cdr_md`, Whisper, Gemini API)
- Joblib for model serialization
- FFmpeg for audio processing

### 🎨 Frontend
- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript (minimal, for interactivity)
- Responsive design (optimized layout and aesthetics)

### 🧪 Data
- `updated_dataset.csv`: Cleaned disease-symptom mapping  
- `symptom_Description.csv`: Disease-wise descriptions  
- `symptom_precaution.csv`: Disease-wise precautionary measures  
- `feedback.csv`: Captures user corrections to improve model
